# Sema
Companion app for Sema, a privacy-first IoT display device. This app handles one-time OAuth authentication and transfers Spotify tokens to the ESP32 device via local WiFi for autonomous playback monitoring. All tokens are stored locally (device EEPROM and local SQLite database). No cloud backend, no remote servers.
